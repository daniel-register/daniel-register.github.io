This is a collection of lessons that I have come across that use 10% as the basis for their rule of thumb. Each of them has been, for me, as much a lesson in temperance as an actual rule to use in  daily life. I hope they hold a nugget for you, too.

### Slow down by 10%

Years ago, when I was a young engineer at Lockheed, I was part of a leadership program that was designed to help talented young engineers prepare for leadership roles within the company. And, as part of this, I was sent to a conference. If you've ever been to a conference, you'll know that the first presentation of the day is called your "keynote" speaker, and they're intended to set the tone for the day by getting you engaged and prepared for the day's content. Most of them are, in fact, terribly boring, and the most interesting keynote speaker was a self-presentation coach. He had a lot to say about the details, like, elevator pitches, slide content, and how to engage audiences (complete with interactive polls), but only one of his points really stuck with me.

He said something like: "If you want to be approachable, you need to slow down by 10%. You need to walk slower, talk slower, maybe even work slower. If you're hustling to your next meeting, shuffling papers and speed walking, no one is going to stop you in the hall and ask if you're interested in a new project. At 90% of your top speed, everything important will still get done, but you'll be available to say 'yes'."

### Increase load by 10%

In training for long-distance running, there's a rule for protecting your tendons: only increase your mileage week-over-week by 10%. This is about the pace your tendons can consistently strengthen, and it makes for a both surprisingly gentle and surprisingly strenuous training regime.

When I trained for my first half-marathon and then my first triathlon, I used this rule on all rep-based parts of my training regimes, hit my goals, and never suffered injury. Each time I would start my exercise, it was a thrill to know that I could do a new distance even before I started, and such a drain to know how much effort it would take, which I think are both signs of a well-balanced exercise.

I've also come to apply this in other parts of my life: if I don't want to burn out, I can only improve by 10% this week. That may mean: one healthy meal this week. Or, going to bed on-time once this week. Or, getting up early once, or exercising once, or spending time with my kids once, or working on the yard once. And, not all at the same time, but just one improvement during this 7-day period.

### Take a WAG with 10%

WAG is short for Wild Guess. In many cases, when you're trying to draw conclusions from sweeping samples, 1/10th is a handy rule for creating a conservative estimate. i.e.:
- Of all of my time at work, how many hours a week do I spend at peak productivity?
- Left alone with a tub of ice cream, how much will be left if I remember to restrain myself?
- In a given population, what fraction makes the big problems we spend our time on?

Let's use the last in an illustration: 
- Let's say we have 1000 customers, what fraction of them will experience a problem? 100?
- Of those that experience a problem, how many cannot be resolved in a single interaction? 10?
- Of those with "complex" problems, how many customers cannot be satisfied with the resolution? 1?

This guesstimate may or may not be accurate, but it helps us establish a baseline and create starting expectations in the absence of concrete data. In this case, it gives us an estimate for the amount of time we can expect to spend on customer service for a given number of customers. In this naive case, maybe that means that a full time employee can handle the customer-service aspect for ~1000 customers given a few hours a week.
